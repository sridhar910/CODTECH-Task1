Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source], containing information about houses including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors influencing house prices.

Usage
To train and evaluate the model, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided:
Copy code
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
or
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Model Training
The project employs machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to predict house prices. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are used to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Visualization techniques like scatter plots and residual plots are used for better understanding of model performance.
